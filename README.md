# MLS Talent ID
- Use machine learning to identify undervalued players in the MLS

# MLS Base Salary Prediction Model
- The Base Salary Prediction Model was created to estimate a player's salary based on several factors such as event data, age, and position. The salary predictions are meant to be used as comparisons to the players' true salaries and identify undervalued players in the MLS. A Gaussian Process Regression machine learning model was fit using the squared exponential function in MATLAB. In the report below, the analysis was focused on identifying undervalued players in the Under-20 age range. Though the player names are removed from the dataset and report, it was later revealed that the three players I identified in my analysis were Efrain Alvarez (Player J8), Cole Bassett (Player D4), and Gianluca Busio (Player X8). With more data, a more precise model could be created with targeted selections. Based on the needs of the club, analysis can be performed to identify undervalued players based on specific positions, playstyles, leagues, and other attributes. 

# Motivation
- This project was completed as part of an interview with Atlanta United. I was provided with a blind data set (player and team names were removed) of basic event data for 15-20 MLS games as well as player salaries. I was tasked with finding and presenting any insights I could find from the data set. I decided to create a salary prediction model that could be used to identify undervalued players.
